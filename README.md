- a few own examples

The question is not whether we like the conclusion that emerges out of a train of reasoning, but whether the conclusion follows from the premise or starting point and whether the premise is true.

#### Bad practices (what you should NOT do)
1. Theory influences observations
(a) Cinnamon was a valuable Asian spice, and the first New World shrub that smelled like cinnamon was declared to be it.
(b) Quantum physics changed how we analyze subatomic events. In fact, we do not do the analysis for separate events anymore.

2. The observer changes the observed
(a) Anthropologists study a tribe which may alter the behavior of the tribe members.
(b) Building an apparatus to measure electrons might change the behavior of the electrons.

3. Equipment constructs results
(a) Using a specific fisher's net:
    (i) no sea-creature is less than 2 inches long.
    (ii) all sea-creatures have gills.
An ichthyologist then might say:“Anything uncatchable by my net is ipso facto outside the scope of ichthyological knowledge and not part of the kingdom of fishes.“
(b) Bad telescopes were the reason why in earlier days people thought that Saturn consists of three parts instead of having rings.

4. Anecdotes do not make a science
Ten anecdotes are not better than one. 100 anecdotes are not better than ten.
(a) “Aunt Mary's cancer was cured by watching Marx brothers movies.”
(b) “Farmer Bob is a very honest guy and told us that he was kidnapped by aliens last month.” Where is the evidence?

5. Scientific language does not make a science
(a) “This planet has been slumbering for eons and with the inception of higher energy frequencies is about to awaken in term of consciousness and spirituality. Masters of limitation and masters of divination use the same creative force to manifest their realities, however, one moves in a downward spiral and the latter moves in an upward spiral, each increasing the resonant vibration inherent in them.”
Where is the evidence, experimental testing, and corroboration?
(b) Creationists often use scientific terms.

6. Bold statements do not make claims true
High probability of pseudo-science if there are enormous claims used.
(a) “The creation of Dianetics is a milestone for man comparable to his discovery of fire and superior to his invention of the wheel and arch.”
(b) Wilhelm Reich's Orgonomy: “a revolution in biology and psychology comparable to the Copernican Revolution”
Also scientists do that mistake sometimes:
(c) Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann 1989 press conference: “Cold nuclear fusion works!”
50 years of physics would have been proven wrong. The experiment was not reproducible by others.

7. Heresy does not equal correctness
They laughed at Copernicus and the Wright brothers. But still being laughed at does not make any ideas more valid.
(a) Wilhelm Reich: “Whatever you have done to me or will do to me in the future, whether you glorify me as a genius or put me in a mental institution, whether you adore me as your savior or hang me as a spy, sooner or later necessity will force you to comprehend that I have discovered the laws of the living.“

8. Burden of proof
The person making the extraordinary claim has the burden of proving to the experts and to the community at large that his or her belief has more validity than the one almost everyone accepts.
(a) Evolutionists and Darwin had the burden of proof for half a century but now the burden of proof is on creationists.
(b) Holocaust deniers have to prove that it did not happen.

9. Rumors do not equal reality
(a) Urban legends, ... most of them were never confirmed.

10. Unexplained is not inexplicable
(a) An amateur archeologist declares that because he cannot figure out how the pyramids were built, they must have been constructed by space aliens.

11. Failures are rationalized
Real scientists will admit errors, pseudoscientists will rationalize their failures.
(a) “My power usually works but this situation of the test or with these cameras has a bad influence on my psychic powers.“
(b) “My powers are mythical and come and go, so when pressured I sometimes have to cheat.“

12. After-the-fact reasoning
(a) A Baseball player does not shave and hits two home-runs in a row. Then he thinks it was because he did not shave. If he did shave but did wear different shoes than normally he would have thought that it was because of the shoes.
Science works the other way round: First you make a claim: “Not shaving increases the probability to do home-runs.“ and then you check out if in the long run you make more home-runs than normally.
(b) People take whole packages of homeopathic medicine to demonstrate that it has no effect. The homeopath says: “Look how good it is. It has no side effects!”

13. Coincidence
(a) A gambler will win six times in a row and then think that he is in a hot streak.
(b) The phone rings and you think it is Bob. When it is Bob you think that this means anything.
What are the chances that this happens? It will happen sometimes. In addition we have the tendency to remember the hits and forget the misses (see 14.).

14. Representativeness
Aristotle: “The sum of coincidences equals certainty.“
(a) Psychics make hundreds of predictions for the next year and a few will hit because of probability. Then they only communicate the hits or we will only remember the hits and emphasize them more.



15. Emotive words and false analogies
Motherhood, America, integrity, honesty might invoke positive reactions, words like rape, cancer, evil, communist might lead to negative reactions.
(a) „The cancer of society,“ „raping the environment,“ Memes, ...
The thinking can be clouded by this.

16. Appeal to ignorance
(a) If you cannot prove that there isn't any psychic power, then there must be.
(b) If you cannot prove that Santa Claus does not exist, then he must exist.
(c) If you cannot prove that Santa Claus exists, then he must not exist.
In science, believe should come from positive evidence in support of a claim, not lack of evidence for OR against it.

17. Ad hominem and tu quoque
Literally “to the man“ and “you also“.
Fallacy to redirect focus from thinking about the idea to thinking about the person holding the idea.
(a) Responding to somebody saying: “Hitler did not have a master plan for the Extermination of the European Jewry“ with “You are a neo-Nazi and an anti-Semite“ does not refute the argument. Whether Hitler had a master plan is a question that can be settled historically.
(b) T. Colin Campbell (author of “The China Study” answering the critical analysis of his book, don't confuse with the real study “Diet, Life-Style, and Mortality in China”): “She claims to have no biases – either for or against – but nonetheless liberally uses adjectives and cutesy expressions that leaves me wondering.”
(c) “You cheat on taxes!“ - „So do you!“ is not a proof in one way or another.

18. Hasty generalization
Prejudice, drawing conclusions before the facts warrant it
(a) A couple of bad teachers mean a bad school.
(b) A few bad cars mean that the brand of the automobiles is unreliable.
(c) A handful of members of a group are used to judge the entire group.

19. Over-reliance on authorities
(a) If Einstein says that the world is flat he must be right.
(b) If a homeless person tells us that our lifestyle of consumption will lead to severe problems with nature he is wrong or jealous.
Examine the evidence instead of the status of the speaker!

20. Either-or (Fallacy of negation, false dilemma) and excluded middle
(a) Creationists say: „Life was either divinely created or evolved.“
It is not enough to discredit another theory. If your theory is superior it must explain the „normal“ data explained by the old theory plus the „anomalous“ data the old theory was not able to explain.
(b) Either you love your country or you hate it.
(c) If you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem.
(d) Special case short-term vs. Long-term: „We can't afford programs to feed malnourished children and educate pre-school kids. We need to urgently deal with crime on the streets.“

21. Circular reasoning (Fallacy of redundancy, tautology) and begging the question
(a) “Is there a God?“ - “Yes.“ - “How do you know?“ - “Because the bible says so.“ - “How do you know the Bible is correct?“ - “Because it was inspired by God.“ = “God is because God is.“
(b) “What is gravity?“ - “The tendency for objects to be attracted to one another.“ - “Why are objects attracted to one another?“ - “Gravity.“ = “Gravity is because gravity is.“
A tautological operational definition can still be useful, but we should try to construct operational definitions that can be tested, falsified, and refuted.
(c) “We must institute the death penalty to discourage violent crime.”
Does the violent crime rate in fact fall when the death penalty is imposed? Independent evidence?

22. Reductio ad absurdum and the slippery slope
(a) “Eating Ben & Jerry's ice cream will cause you put on weight. Putting on weight will make you overweight. Soon you will weigh 350 pounds and die of heart disease. Eating Ben & Jerry's ice cream leads to death. Don't even try it.“ Eating one scoop could contribute to overweight but the consequences do not necessarily follow from the premise.
Slippery slope = don't even take the first step because it ultimately leads to an extreme end.
Reductio ad absurdum = refutation of an argument by carrying the argument to it's logical end and so reducing it to an absurd conclusion.
(b) If the state prohibits abortion even in the ninth month, it will soon be telling us what to do with our bodies around the time of conception.

23. Effort inadequacies and the need for certainty, control, and simplicity
Uncertainties lead the mind to look for explanations.
Most of us are looking for easy explanations but this can lead to oversimplification.
(a) “People do steal because of their bad genes.“
(b) “He does not like me because he is bad.“
(c) “He was raised to dislike certain people.“

24. Problem-solving inadequacies (confirmation bias)
People tend to
(i) Immediately form a hypothesis and look only for examples to confirm it.
(ii) Do not seek evidence to disprove the hypothesis.
(iii) Are very slow to change the hypothesis even when it is obviously wrong.
(iv) If the information is too complex, adopt overly-simple hypotheses or strategies for solutions.
(v) If there is no solution, if the problem is a trick and “right“ and “wrong“ is given at random, form hypotheses about coincidental relationships they observed. Causality is always found.

25. Ideological immunity, or the planck problem
“immunity“ built up against new ideas by confidence in the own fundamental paradigm.
David Perkins: The more confirmation one found for his ideology (remember 24 (i) and (ii) – not seeking for counter-evidence) the less apt he is to change his opinion.
The higher the IQ (measured by a standard IQ test) the more reasons are given to defend the own point of view and the lower the probability to consider alternatives.

26. Argument from adverse consequences
(a) “The defendant in a widely publicized murder trial must be found guilty; otherwise, it will be an encouragement for other men to murder their wives.”

27. Special pleading
Often to rescue a deep rhetorical trouble
(a) “How could God permit the followers of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam – each in their own way enjoined to heroic measures of loving kindness and compassion – to have perpetrated so much cruelty for so long?“ - “You don't understand Free Will. God moves in mysterious ways.“



28. Statistics of small numbers
(a) “They say 1 out of every 5 people is Chinese. How is this possible? I know hundreds of people, and none of them is Chinese.“

29. Misunderstanding of the nature of statistics; confusion of correlation and causation; post hoc, ergo propter hoc (it happened after, so it was caused by)
(a) President Dwight Eisenhower expressing astonishment and alarm on discovering that fully half of all Americans have below average intelligence.
(b) A survey shows that more college graduates are homosexual than those with lesser education; therefore education makes people gay.
(c) Before women got the vote, there were no nuclear weapons.

30. Inconsistency
(a) Attributing the declining life expectancy in the former Soviet Union to the failures of communism many years ago, but never attributing the high infant mortality in the United States to the failures of capitalism.
(b) People using this Baloney Detection Kit to point out the flaws in other people's thinking but not using it to check their own beliefs.

31. Non sequitur (it does not follow)
(a) “Our nation will prevail because God is great.“

32. Meaningless question
(a) What happens when an irresistible force meets an immovable object?
If there is an irresistible force there cannot be an immovable object and vice versa.

33. Straw man
caricaturing a position to make it easier to attack
(a) Scientists suppose that living things simply fell together by chance.
This formulation willfully ignores the central Darwinian insight, that Nature ratchets up by saving what works and discarding what doesn't.
(b) Environmentalists care more for snail darters and spotted owls than they do for people.

34. Suppressed evidence, half-truths
(a) “An amazingly and widely quoted 'prophecy' of the assassination attempt on President Reagan is shown on television.“
A detail is missing: was it recorded before or after the event?
(b) “These government abuses demand revolution even if you can't make an omelette without breaking some eggs.“
Is this likely to be a revolution in which far more people are killed than under the previous regime? What does the experience of other revolutions suggest? Are all revolutions against oppressive regimes desirable and in the interests of the people?

35. Weasel words
(a) The United States may not conduct a war without a declaration by Congress. Therefore other words are used:
police actions, armed incursions, protective reaction strikes, pacification, safeguarding American interests, operations
Talleyrand: “An important art of politicians is to find new names for institutions which under old names have become odious to the public.“






#### Good practices (what you should do):
A. Independent confirmation of the “facts“ whenever possible
Make it more unlikely that something else is/was going on.

B. Encourage debate on the evidence
Knowledgeable proponents of all points of view should participate so you get different explanations. Compare with C.

C. Spin more than one hypothesis
If there is something to be explained, think of all the different ways in which it could be explained. Then think of tests how to disprove each of the alternatives. What remains , meaning resists disproof, has a much better chance of being the right answer than just running with the first idea.

D. Try not to get overly attached to a hypothesis just because it's yours
It's only a way station in the pursuit of knowledge. Ask yourself, why you like the idea. See if you find reasons for rejecting it. If you don't, others will.

E. Quantify
If there is some measure, some numerical quantity attached to what you try to explain, it will be much easier to discriminate among competing hypotheses. Of course there are truths to be sought in the many qualitative issues we are obliged to confront, but finding them is more challenging.

F. Every link of a chain argument has to work
This includes the premise! It is not enough if most of the links work if you want to conclude anything from it.

G. Occam's Razor
Rule-of-thumb: If there are two hypotheses explaining the data equally well, choose the simpler one.
Simpler here means less assumptions and less unproven assumptions. Don't confuse with “easy explanations” which often make the greatest assumptions!
(a) The hypothesis that everything in the universe is moving and turning around the earth makes the derivation of physical laws (planetary orbits moving in relation to the earth) much more complicated than if the earth is only one part and also moving.
(b) Healing people works by laying on of hands.

H. Always ask if the hypothesis at least in principle can be falsified
Inveterate skeptics must be given the chance to follow your reasoning, to duplicate your experiments and to see if they get the same result. Proportions that are untestable, unfalsifiable are not worth much.


Like all tools the baloney detection [guidelines] can be misused, applied out of context, or even employed as a rote alternative to thinking. But applied judiciously, it can make all the difference in the world – not least in evaluating our own arguments before we present them to others.


### Baloney Detection Guidelines - Short Version

Source: Michael Shermer: Baloney Detection Kit

1. How reliable is the source?
Errors should be random and not all pointing in the same direction.
Global warming sceptics will pick certain data that slants toward a particular belief.

2. Does the source make similar claims?
New Age people making claims that UFOs exist, ghosts exist, healing by touching people, ...

3. Have the claims been verified by somebody else?
“Cold fusion works, we can produce it!“ Nobody else was able to.

4. Does this fit with the way the world works?
“If you send 100 Euro you will get 500 back.“, “The pyramids are too complex to have been built by Egyptians.“

5. Has anyone tried to disprove the claim?
You have to think about what your critics would say. Try to disprove your own claim. Good example: Darwin's “On the Origin of Species“ Chapter VI “Difficulties on Theory“

6. Where does the preponderance of evidence point?
Creationists: “There is no intermediate fossil between elomeryx and hippopotamus. Therefore the evolution theory is wrong.“ What about the vast amount of intermediate fossils for whales for example?
Think of solving a criminal case and collecting so much evidence that you are able to say with high probability who was the murderer.

7. Is the claimant playing by the rules of science?
Difference of UFO-proponents and the SETI community. SETI tries to find other explanations to disprove its findings for example while UFO-proponents only interpret evidence in the way they need it.

8. Is the claimant providing positive evidence?
”Where is the evidence that an alien space ship crashed at Roswell?“ - “They've hidden it!“
“There are covered up passages in government documents, therefore they are trying to not let us find out that aliens visited us!“
“Bigfoot is out there! Well, the Bigfoots are very secretive and there are very few of them, so there is no body.“

9. Does the new theory account for as many phenomena as the old theory?
Is there another theory that explains the data which the theory of evolution explains and on top of it explains data the theory of evolution is not able to?
“I have worked out that new theory of physics that explains the world!“ - “Does it explain what the theory of relativity explains? Does it explain what Newton found out about gravity? Does it explain all that quantum physics explains?“

10. Are personal beliefs driving the claim?
Somebody who is pro business: “Global warming does not happen.“, “Humans are not responsible for global warming.“
Somebody who believes in God: “The different species were created and did not evolve.“
